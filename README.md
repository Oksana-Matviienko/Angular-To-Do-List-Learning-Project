Angular To-Do List Learning Project

This project is a practical implementation I developed as part of my Angular course. It’s a modern take on the classic To-Do List application, featuring extended functionality: multiple users with the ability to assign tasks individually for each user.

Features

Multi-user functionality: Each user has their own task list, enabling personalized task management.
Dynamic task management: Add, delete, and manage tasks for individual users in real-time.
Responsive design: The application is designed to work seamlessly across various devices.

What I Learned
While building this application, I gained hands-on experience with Angular's core features and principles. The project helped me solidify my understanding of:

Component-based architecture: Structuring the app into reusable and maintainable components.
Data binding: Implementing two-way data binding for dynamic updates to the UI.
Services and dependency injection (DI): Centralizing logic and sharing data across components in a modular way.
State management: Managing application state effectively, especially with multiple users.
Event handling: Using Angular's event emitters to create responsive and interactive components.
Form handling: Validating user inputs and managing forms using Angular’s reactive forms module.
